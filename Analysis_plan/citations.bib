  abstract   = {Study Objective:
                To investigate the associations between sleep stage distributions and subsequent decline in cognitive function in older men over time.

                Design:
                A population-based prospective substudy of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study.

                Settings:
                Six sites in the United States.

                Participants:
                Community-dwelling men aged 67 y or older (n = 2,601), who were free of probable dementia at sleep visit. Follow-up averaged 3.4 y.

                Measurement and Results:
                Sleep stages were identified by in-home polysomnography at the initial sleep visit (2003–2005). Cognitive outcomes were assessed with the Trail Making Test Part B and Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) at sleep visit and two follow-up visits. After adjusting for multiple confounders compared with men in the lowest quartile of percent of sleep time spent in Stage N1, those in the highest quartile had a twofold increase in cognitive decline for both cognitive tests (adjusted annualized percent change/y: Trail Making Test Part B Q1 = 1.06, Q4 = 2.45, P = 0.01; 3MS Q1 = −0.27, Q4 = −0.48, P = 0.03). In addition, compared with men in the highest quartile, men in the lowest quartile of percent of sleep time in Stage R revealed more cognitive decline on the 3MS (adjusted annualized percent change/y: Q1 = −0.49, Q4 = −0.22, P = 0.003). These findings were consistent even after further adjustment of total sleep time and sleep disordered breathing. No significant relationships between other sleep stages (N2, N3) and cognitive change were found.

                Conclusion:
                Increased time in Stage N1 sleep and less time in Stage REM sleep are associated with worsening cognitive performance in older men over time.

  abstract = {Slow-wave sleep (SWS) supports the aging brain in many ways, including facilitating the glymphatic clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer disease. However, the role of SWS in the development of dementia remains equivocal.To determine whether SWS loss with aging is associated with the risk of incident dementia and examine whether Alzheimer disease genetic risk or hippocampal volumes suggestive of early neurodegeneration were associated with SWS loss.This prospective cohort study included participants in the Framingham Heart Study who completed 2 overnight polysomnography (PSG) studies in the time periods 1995 to 1998 and 2001 to 2003. Additional criteria for individuals in this study sample were an age of 60 years or older and no dementia at the time of the second overnight PSG. Data analysis was performed from January 2020 to August 2023.Changes in SWS percentage measured across repeated overnight sleep studies over a mean of 5.2 years apart (range, 4.8-7.1 years).Risk of incident all-cause dementia adjudicated over 17 years of follow-up from the second PSG.From the 868 Framingham Heart Study participants who returned for a second PSG, this cohort included 346 participants with a mean age of 69 years (range, 60-87 years); 179 (52\%) were female. Aging was associated with SWS loss across repeated overnight sleep studies (mean [SD] change, −0.6 [1.5\%] per year; P \&lt; .001). Over the next 17 years of follow-up, there were 52 cases of incident dementia. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, cohort, positivity for at least 1 APOE ε4 allele, smoking status, sleeping medication use, antidepressant use, and anxiolytic use, each percentage decrease in SWS per year was associated with a 27\% increase in the risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.54; P = .01). SWS loss with aging was accelerated in the presence of Alzheimer disease genetic risk (ie, APOE ε4 allele) but not hippocampal volumes measured proximal to the first PSG.This cohort study found that slow-wave sleep percentage declined with aging and Alzheimer disease genetic risk, with greater reductions associated with the risk of incident dementia. These findings suggest that SWS loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.},

  abstract = {Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment—the target experiment or target trial—that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guid@e decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

  abstract  = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

  abstract      = {Many research questions -- particularly those in environmental health -- do not involve binary exposures. In environmental epidemiology, this includes multivariate exposure mixtures with nondiscrete components. Causal inference estimands and estimators to quantify the relationship between an exposure mixture and an outcome are relatively few. We propose an approach to quantify a relationship between a shift in the exposure mixture and the outcome -- either in the single timepoint or longitudinal setting. The shift in the exposure mixture can be defined flexibly in terms of shifting one or more components, including examining interaction between mixture components, and in terms of shifting the same or different amounts across components. The estimand we discuss has a similar interpretation as a main effect regression coefficient. First, we focus on choosing a shift in the exposure mixture supported by observed data. We demonstrate how to assess extrapolation and modify the shift to minimize reliance on extrapolation. Second, we propose estimating the relationship between the exposure mixture shift and outcome completely nonparametrically, using machine learning in model-fitting. This is in contrast to other current approaches, which employ parametric modeling for at least some relationships, which we would like to avoid because parametric modeling assumptions in complex, nonrandomized settings are tenuous at best. We are motivated by longitudinal data on pesticide exposures among participants in the CHAMACOS Maternal Cognition cohort. We examine the relationship between longitudinal exposure to agricultural pesticides and risk of hypertension. We provide step-by-step code to facilitate the easy replication and adaptation of the approaches we use.},

  abstract = {In failure-time settings, a competing event is any event that makes it impossible for the event of interest to occur. For example, cardiovascular disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events, contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of interest or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not mediated by the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be represented in causal diagrams, in which competing events are depicted as time-varying covariates. We present an application of these ideas to data from a randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of estrogen therapy on prostate cancer mortality.},
